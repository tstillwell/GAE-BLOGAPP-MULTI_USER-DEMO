# Multi-User Blog for Google App Engine

#### A responsive blogging engine designed for multiple users

This app is built to allow different users to sign up and easily blog.
It is not walled or gated so **anyone** can sign up
and post directly to the front page out of the box.

It uses Google's App Engine platform and runs on the standard (free) environment
and can be deployed to app engine in less than a mintue.



Each user gets their own page and RSS feed containing their posts.
The users can edit or delete their posts at any time.

Commenting is built in to the app and does not require external services.


It uses javascript for visual enhancements but degrades gracefully if users have javascript disabled.

The blog is easily customizable with css.

There are several security features built in to prevent hijacking and abuse.
