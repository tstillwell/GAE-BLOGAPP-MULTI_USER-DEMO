## Environment Info
Google App Engine is a Platform as a Service (PaaS)
that runs on Google's cloud infrastructure.

http://cloud.google.com/appengine/

App Engine supports multiple languages and runtimes-
this app uses the
__Python Standard Environment__
(as opposed to the flexible environment)

http://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/

The standard environment uses Python 2.7.9 with a lightweight python runtime.
For an overview of this environment see
http://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/runtime

For more info about environment limitations, see the _Limitations_ section

If you want to customize / test the app before deploying, you will
need to use the App Engine SDK which includes a local development server so you
can simulate App Engine on your system.
